Task 1 - Create an html page with the ability to enter a numeric value through the buttons (more, less). The user should not be able to type text or numbers. The number changes only when the buttons are pressed.

Task 2 - Create an html page with a Like button that increments the like counter when clicked.

Task 3 - Create html page with text and color palette. When you click on the palette color, the text color should change to the selected one. To specify which cell corresponds to which color, you can use the data-color attribute in each cell, and then use JS to get the required color from this attribute.

Task 4 - Create an html page "Calculator". Implement its functionality.
